w3m: terminal-based web browser & pager
=======================================

This repository is for the continued development of the w3m web
browser and pager, since upstream seems to have died down. It is
based on w3m 0.5.3, released 2011-01-15.

w3m is ideal for browsing content-focused websites such as
Wikipedia, blogs, and websites where the clutter displayed by
graphical web browsers gets in the way of the actual content.

It currently runs on OpenBSD, and compiles using BSD make, not
GNU autotools. Releases which can run on other platforms are
expected to be released when the libtls API is finalized, after
the release of OpenBSD 5.7.

Features
--------
* Protocols: HTTPS, HTTP, FTP
* Tables, images (in some circumstances) - including animated gifs,
hyperlinks, forms, cookies, lists, horizontal rules.
* vi(1)-like control scheme

Goals
-----
* Improve security standards...
* Use libtls from [libressl](http://libressl.org) to implement
Transport Layer Security (HTTPS) cleanly. (complete)
* Format the code to a more readable style where every block is
indented. (complete)
* Clean up code for readability and easier auditing.
* Use secure string handling everywhere. Carefully check each
call is correct and cannot lead to buffer overflows and other
security problems.
* Insert checks for integer overflow where necessary.
* Use modern C (size_t, const, enums, snprintf, etc).
* Compile cleanly (without warnings) using strict compiler settings.
* Remove counter-intuitive features and #ifdefs which clutter the
code and make it harder to understand (DOS support, etc).
* Add support for newer and unimplemented HTML elements.
